                <h3>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</h3>
                <p>Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense,
                    very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped
                    onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking,
                    but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super
                    tense and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages
                    Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be
                    a Star Wars fan!

                <h3>I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.
                </h3>
                <p>Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this
                    movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't. I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure
                    was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor
                    wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good
                    old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well,
                    CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will
                    love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.
